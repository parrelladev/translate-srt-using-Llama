1
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,808
There.

2
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:29,994
That's them.

3
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,653
Your play, Walter.

4
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,060
You're on your own.

5
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:03,407
Looks like you're about
1,000 gallons light here, Mike.

6
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:04,741
Where's the juice?

7
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,682
The methylamine isn't coming.

8
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,303
Why is that?

9
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,167
And who the hell are you?

10
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:16,111
I'm the man who's keeping it.

11
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:18,505
What the hell's this?

12
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:21,224
We had an agreement,
right? We got our deal.
